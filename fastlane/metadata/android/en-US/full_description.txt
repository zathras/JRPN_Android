Programmer's calculator based on Emmet Gray's WRPN 16c, which simulates
an HP 16c.  This is an RPN-based calculator that works in floating point,
and integers expressed in hex, decimal, octal or binary.  I modified Emmet's 
WRPN (with permission) so that it uses rendered fonts for the keys. This 
makes them look nice and crisp on high resolution displays.

I offer this software as-is, with no guarantee of any kind. The source is 
available on github. There's also a desktop Java version -- see 
https://jrpn.jovial.com/ for both.
